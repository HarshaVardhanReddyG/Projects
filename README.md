## Projects
# Community Q&A Website ( February 2023 )

· Developed a primitive Q&A website for accessing information, solving problems, and exchanging ideas.

· Implemented features like creating, editing and deleting questions, answers, upvotes, downvotes, user
authentication, paging, user search, multi-tag search, filters.


# eDHCP ( November 2023 )

· It is an extension to DHCP which ensures security for both server and client enabling simultaneous

authentication. The security is established via certificates facilitated by asymmetric key-based authentication. Used mininet environment for implementation.

# Kaggle Project ( November 2023 )

· Conducted preprocessing on the input data like feature selection using heatmaps and predicting missing
values through k-NN prediction and imputation.

· Trained various ensemble models such as Random Forests, Adaboost, and Gradient Boosting, to analyze
the dataset and make predictions.

# Image Recognition and Classification (April 2024 )
· Trained a variety of CNN architectures, including ResNet, ConvNeXt, and DenseNet, alongside Transformer models such as Vision Transformer on a subset of the ILSVRC dataset.

· Applied various data transformations, such as random flips, random rotations, color jittering, and normalization for making better predictions.

· Saved model weights at regular intervals to avoid repeated trainings. Employed ensemble learning techniques, including bagging, by integrating predictions from various CNN and Transformer models for better accuracy. 

# Resource Sharing and Synchronization ( February 2022 )

· Implemented TAS, CAS, and Bounded CAS mutual exclusive algorithms for the synchronization of
various threads that share a common lock.

· I developed a multithreading program to synchronize interactions between an Ice Cream Vendor and
Families for selling and refilling ice creams using C++ threads, semaphores, and mutex locks
