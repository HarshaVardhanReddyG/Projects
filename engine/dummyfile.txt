This is the code for Query-Only adversary attacks simulation.
It contains two files: BF_v2.py and flowRadar_v2.py
BF_v2 contains the functions needed for the simulation.
flowRadar_v2 contains functions related to the BloomFilter and the decoding process.
in the main file 'BF_v2.py', the main function calls the BloomFilter func. the first two lines need to be changed.(comments have been added for it)
to run the file:
    python3 BF_v2.py
    then enter the percentage of malicious flows to be crafted when prompted.
    <The packet counts is based on the top x %>

All parts are commented and extraneous functions are included.
